# Clone With A Twist exercise for Unity VR Pathway tutorials

Aim: Create a basic card-based board game in the vein of Demeo, but reminiscent of certain Yu-Gi-Oh! anime gameplay variants.  
i.e. **De-Me-Oh!**

## How to play
1) Use the grip button to move the cards on your arm disk into the black centre slot to move the figurine on the board.
2) First, move your figurine to the key, then to the green exit square, in as few turns as possible.
3) Use the trigger to interact with the UI above the middle of the gameboard, to either restart or exit the game.
